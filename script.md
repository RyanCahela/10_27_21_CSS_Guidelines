 1. Use Multiple Files.
 - whether you are using a build tool like sass or vanilla css you should break up your css into multiple files.
 - with vanilla css just import them at the top of your HTML, just remember that css uses source order to determine which styles to apply so the files being imported  below the others could overwrite them if targeting the same element with the same specificty.

 2. Titleing - using comments to mark parts of your code. Applies to CSS and HTML. (then show b-roll of that example)

 4. Use a naming convention, BEM is a good place to start. (show simple BEM example and explain it doesn't have to follow the paper trail of your html)
